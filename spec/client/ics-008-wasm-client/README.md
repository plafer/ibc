## Synopsis

This specification document describes an interface to a client (verification algorithm) stored as a Wasm bytecode for a blockchain.

### Motivation

Currently adding a new client implementation or upgrading an existing one requires a hard upgrade because the client implementations are part of the static chain binary. Any change to the on-chain light client code is dependent on chain governance to approve an upgrade before it can be deployed.

This may be acceptable when adding new client types, since the number of unique consensus algorithms that need to be supported is currently small. However, this process will become very tedious when it comes to upgrading light clients.

Without dynamically upgradable light clients, a chain that wishes to upgrade its consensus algorithm (and thus break existing light clients) must wait for all counterparty chains to perform a hard upgrade that adds support for the upgraded light client before it itself can perform an upgrade on its chain. Examples of a consensus-breaking upgrade would be an upgrade from Tendermint v1 to a light-client breaking Tendermint v2 or switching from Tendermint consensus to Honeybadger. Changes to the internal state-machine logic will not affect consensus, e.g. changes to staking module do not require an IBC upgrade.

Requiring all counterparties to statically add new client implementations to their binaries will inevitably slow the pace of upgrades in the IBC network, since the deployment of an upgrade on even a very experimental, fast-moving chain will be blocked by an upgrade to a high-value chain that will be inherently more conservative.

Once the IBC network broadly adopts dynamically upgradable clients, a chain may upgrade its consensus algorithm whenever it wishes and relayers may upgrade the client code of all counterparty chains without requiring the counterparty chains to perform an upgrade themselves. This prevents a dependency on counterparty chains when considering upgrading one's own consensus algorithm.

### Definitions

Functions & terms are as defined in [ICS 2](../../core/ics-002-client-semantics).

`currentTimestamp` is as defined in [ICS 24](../../core/ics-024-host-requirements).

`Wasm Client Code` refers to Wasm bytecode stored in the client store, which provides a target blockchain specific implementation of [ICS 2](../../core/ics-002-client-semantics).

`Wasm Client` refers to a particular instance of `Wasm Client Code` defined as a tuple `(Wasm Client Code, ClientID)`.

`Wasm VM` refers to a virtual machine capable of executing valid Wasm bytecode.


### Desired Properties

This specification must satisfy the client interface defined in ICS 2.

## Technical Specification

This specification depends on the correct instantiation of the `Wasm client` and is decoupled from any specific implementation of the target `blockchain` consensus algorithm.

### Client state

The Wasm client state tracks location of the Wasm bytecode via `codeId`. Binary data represented by `data` field is opaque and only interpreted by the Wasm Client Code. `type` represents client type.
`type` and `codeId` both are immutable.

```typescript
interface ClientState {
  codeId: []byte
  data: []byte
  latestHeight: Height
}
```

### Consensus state

The Wasm consensus state tracks the timestamp (block time), `Wasm Client code` specific fields and commitment root for all previously verified consensus states.
`type` and `codeId` both are immutable.

```typescript
interface ConsensusState {
  codeId: []byte
  data: []byte
  timestamp: uint64
}
```

### Height

The height of a Wasm light client instance consists of two `uint64`s: the revision number, and the height in the revision.

```typescript
interface Height {
  revisionNumber: uint64
  revisionHeight: uint64
}
```

Comparison between heights is implemented as follows:

```typescript
function compare(a: Height, b: Height): Ord {
  if (a.revisionNumber < b.revisionNumber)
    return LT
  else if (a.revisionNumber === b.revisionNumber)
    if (a.revisionHeight < b.revisionHeight)
      return LT
    else if (a.revisionHeight === b.revisionHeight)
      return EQ
  return GT
}
```

This is designed to allow the height to reset to `0` while the revision number increases by one in order to preserve timeouts through zero-height upgrades.

### Headers

Contents of Wasm client headers depend upon `Wasm Client Code`.

```typescript
interface Header {
  data: []byte
  height: Height
}
```

### Misbehaviour

The `Misbehaviour` type is used for detecting misbehaviour and freezing the client - to prevent further packet flow - if applicable.
Wasm client `Misbehaviour` consists of two conflicting headers both of which the light client would have considered valid.

```typescript
interface Misbehaviour {
  clientId: string
  h1: Header
  h2: Header
}
```

### Client initialisation

Wasm client initialisation requires a (subjectively chosen) latest consensus state interpretable by the target Wasm Client Code. `wasmCodeId` field is unique identifier for `Wasm Client Code`, and `initializationData` refers to opaque data required for initialization of the particular client managed by that Wasm Client Code.

```typescript
function initialise(
    wasmCodeId: String,
    initializationData: []byte,
    consensusState: []byte,
  ): ClientState {
    codeHandle = getWasmCode(wasmCodeId)
    assert(codeHandle.isInitializationDataValid(initializationData, consensusState))

    store = getStore("clients/{identifier}")
    return codeHandle.initialise(store, initializationData, consensusState)
}
```

The `latestClientHeight` function returns the latest stored height, which is updated every time a new (more recent) header is validated.

```typescript
function latestClientHeight(clientState: ClientState): Height {
  codeHandle = clientState.codeHandle();
  codeHandle.latestClientHeight(clientState)
}
```

### Validity predicate

Wasm client validity checking uses underlying Wasm Client code. If the provided header is valid, the client state is updated & the newly verified commitment written to the store.

```typescript
function checkValidityAndUpdateState(
  clientState: ClientState,
  header: Header) {
    store = getStore("clients/{identifier}")
    codeHandle = clientState.codeHandle()

    // verify that provided header is valid and state is saved
    assert(codeHandle.validateHeaderAndCreateConsensusState(store, clientState, header))
}
```

### Misbehaviour predicate

Wasm client misbehaviour checking determines whether or not two conflicting headers at the same height would have convinced the light client.

```typescript
function checkMisbehaviourAndUpdateState(
  clientState: ClientState,
  misbehaviour: Misbehaviour) {
    store = getStore("clients/{identifier}")
    codeHandle = clientState.codeHandle()
    assert(codeHandle.handleMisbehaviour(store, clientState, misbehaviour))
}
```

### Upgrades

The chain which this light client is tracking can elect to write a special pre-determined key in state to allow the light client to update its client state (e.g. with a new chain ID or revision) in preparation for an upgrade.

As the client state change will be performed immediately, once the new client state information is written to the predetermined key, the client will no longer be able to follow blocks on the old chain, so it must upgrade promptly.

```typescript
function upgradeClientState(
  clientState: ClientState,
  newClientState: ClientState,
  height: Height,
  proof: CommitmentPrefix) {
    codeHandle = clientState.codeHandle()
    assert(codeHandle.verifyNewClientState(clientState, newClientState, height, proof))

    // update client state
    clientState = newClientState
    set("clients/{identifier}", clientState)
}
```

In case of Wasm client, upgrade of `Wasm Client Code` is also possible via blockchain specific management functionality.

### State verification functions

Wasm client state verification functions check a Merkle proof against a previously validated commitment root.

```typescript
function verifyClientConsensusState(
  clientState: ClientState,
  height: Height,
  prefix: CommitmentPrefix,
  proof: CommitmentProof,
  clientIdentifier: Identifier,
  consensusStateHeight: Height,
  consensusState: ConsensusState) {
    codeHandle = getCodeHandleFromClientID(clientIdentifier)
    assert(codeHandle.verifyClientConsensusState(clientState, height, prefix, clientIdentifier, proof, consensusStateHeight, consensusState))
}

function verifyConnectionState(
  clientState: ClientState,
  height: Height,
  prefix: CommitmentPrefix,
  proof: CommitmentProof,
  connectionIdentifier: Identifier,
  connectionEnd: ConnectionEnd) {
    codeHandle = clientState.codeHandle()
    assert(codeHandle.verifyConnectionState(clientState, height, prefix, proof, connectionIdentifier, connectionEnd))
}

function verifyChannelState(
  clientState: ClientState,
  height: Height,
  prefix: CommitmentPrefix,
  proof: CommitmentProof,
  portIdentifier: Identifier,
  channelIdentifier: Identifier,
  channelEnd: ChannelEnd) {
    codeHandle = clientState.codeHandle()
    assert(codeHandle.verifyChannelState(clientState, height, prefix, proof, portIdentifier, channelIdentifier, channelEnd))
}

function verifyPacketCommitment(
  clientState: ClientState,
  height: Height,
  prefix: CommitmentPrefix,
  proof: CommitmentProof,
  portIdentifier: Identifier,
  channelIdentifier: Identifier,
  sequence: uint64,
  commitment: bytes) {
    codeHandle = clientState.codeHandle()
    assert(codeHandle.verifyPacketCommitment(clientState, height, prefix, proof, portIdentifier, channelIdentifier, sequence, commitment))
}

function verifyPacketAcknowledgement(
  clientState: ClientState,
  height: Height,
  prefix: CommitmentPrefix,
  proof: CommitmentProof,
  portIdentifier: Identifier,
  channelIdentifier: Identifier,
  sequence: uint64,
  acknowledgement: bytes) {
    codeHandle = clientState.codeHandle()
    assert(codeHandle.verifyPacketAcknowledgement(clientState, height, prefix, proof, portportIdentifier, channelIdentifier, sequence, acknowledgement))
}

function verifyPacketReceiptAbsence(
  clientState: ClientState,
  height: Height,
  prefix: CommitmentPrefix,
  proof: CommitmentProof,
  portIdentifier: Identifier,
  channelIdentifier: Identifier,
  sequence: uint64) {
    codeHandle = clientState.codeHandle()
    assert(codeHandle.verifyPacketReceiptAbsence(clientState, height, prefix, proof, portIdentifier, channelIdentifier, sequence))
}

function verifyNextSequenceRecv(
  clientState: ClientState,
  height: Height,
  prefix: CommitmentPrefix,
  proof: CommitmentProof,
  portIdentifier: Identifier,
  channelIdentifier: Identifier,
  nextSequenceRecv: uint64) {
    codeHandle = clientState.codeHandle()
    assert(codeHandle.verifyNextSequenceRecv(clientState, height, prefix, proof, portIdentifier, channelIdentifier, nextSequenceRecv))
}
```

### Wasm Client Code Interface

#### What is code handle?
Code handle is an object that facilitates interaction between Wasm code and go code. For example, consider the method `isValidClientState` which could be implemented like this:

```go
func (c *CodeHandle) isValidClientState(clientState ClientState, height u64) {
    clientStateData := json.Serialize(clientState)
    packedData := pack(clientStateData, height)
    // VM specific code to call Wasm contract
}
```

#### Wasm Client interface
Every Wasm client code need to support ingestion of below messages in order to be used as light client.

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct MisbehaviourMessage {
    pub client_state: Vec<u8>,
    pub consensus_state: Vec<u8>,
    pub height: Height,
    pub header1: Vec<u8>,
    pub header2: Vec<u8>,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct CreateConsensusMessage {
    pub client_state: Vec<u8>,
    pub height: Height
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct InitializeClientStateMessage {
    pub initialization_data: Vec<u8>,
    pub consensus_state: Vec<u8>
}


#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum HandleMsg {
    HandleMisbehaviour(MisbehaviourMessage),
    TryCreateConsensusState(CreateConsensusMessage),
    InitializeClientState(InitializeClientStateMessage)
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct ValidateClientStateMessage {
    client_state: Vec<u8>,
    height: Height
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct ValidateNewClientStateMessage {
    client_state: Vec<u8>,
    new_client_state: Vec<u8>,
    height: Height
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct ValidateInitializationDataMessage {
    init_data: Vec<u8>,
    consensus_state: Vec<u8>
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum ValidityPredicate {
    ClientState(ValidateClientStateMessage),
    NewClientState(ValidateNewClientStateMessage),
    InitializationData(ValidateInitializationDataMessage),
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum QueryMsg {
   IsValid(ValidityPredicate),
   LatestClientHeight(Vec<u8>),
}

```
